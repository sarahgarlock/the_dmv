# The DMV

## Reflection

#### **1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.**

- I rushed this part initially but realized how imortant this is so redid the debugging process. I wrote down the tests that didn't pass and read the Stack to fully understand where the problem was. I noticed that the attributes were written differently on the facility.rb and took note of that and that the spec_helper.rb file looks to come in handy for pulling information from other classes. Having notes from our Debugging class really helped.


#### **2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?**

- I was stuck on an error for awhile but then realized that I needed to change the attr_accessor in another file. I would assume that parts of their code were correct but were infact incorrect and that stumped in some spots. Speaking everything out in plain English helped.

#### **3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?**

- It wasn't quite easy yet but having an idea of how to read a Stack Trace helped a lot. Knowing how to read those errors made this process so much easier
